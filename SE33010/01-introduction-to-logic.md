Formalisation of Software Development
-------------------------------------

1. User's ideas
2. Requirements Specification
3. System specification
4. Programs
5. Executable Machine Code

Last step is often automated. Idea of formal methods is to move the automation up (use tools to automatically generate code).

To do this the specification must be amenable to processing (cannot be a natural language).

Need to use a "formal" specification language.

There is some research into introducing formal notations for requirement specification, but of course (accept in very few examples) you're never going to be able to completely automate this process.

Ideas are very difficult to formalise.

This module focuses on a formal definition for a system specification.

Compilers can be completely automated from requirements.


Specification
-------------

A specification should be:

* Concise
* Complete
* Consistent

It is important to maintain consistency between stages of specification, traditional methods of software development make this difficult.

Mathematical methods of specification can help with this.

Advantages of Formal Specification
----------------------------------

* Makes you think
* Unambiguous language
* May be autonomous
* Automated test data
* Can be proved to be correct rather than tested
* Errors detected earlier
* Adapt to changing requirements easier
